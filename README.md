# Work-Daily-Planner

Week-05-Work Planner

## Description

The purpose behind this project was to build a work calendar that would save my daily activities I had planned for the day. This application also tells you when an item has been put on the calendar in the past, present or future based on the current time. This solves being disorganized and making sure you don't schedule too much on your plate. By doing this, I learned to use jquery syntax and how to transfer data out of the local storage and save it to the html page as well as change elements on the page.
